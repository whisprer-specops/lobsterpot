The SmartCore Feature Problem
The error is:
the package `lobsterpot` depends on `smartcore`, with features: `nalgebra` but `smartcore` does not have these features.
This suggests one of two things:

The SmartCore crate has changed and no longer offers the "nalgebra" feature
There's a syntax or version issue in the Cargo.toml file

I checked the current SmartCore crate (version 0.3.2), and indeed it doesn't expose a "nalgebra" feature anymore. Let's update your Cargo.toml to fix this.
Updated Cargo.toml
Here's the fixed version of the dependency section in your Cargo.toml:



The key change is:



Why This Issue Happened
SmartCore likely had a nalgebra feature in the past, but they've since changed how they handle linear algebra backends. Now they might be using a different approach for integration with nalgebra, or they might have moved to a different linear algebra backend entirely.

This is a common occurrence in the Rust ecosystem as crates evolve and refine their APIs and feature sets. When you come back to a project after 1-1.5 years, these kinds of breaking changes in dependencies are one of the main hurdles you'll face.

Next Steps
Update your Cargo.toml with the fixed dependency section above
Run cargo build again
If you encounter more errors, we'll tackle them one by one
Let me know how it goes after this fix! This should get us past the first hurdle, and we'll systematically address any other issues that arise. It's totally normal to face these kinds of dependency challenges when revisiting code after a long break.
