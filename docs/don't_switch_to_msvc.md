welp fren - that was pure horror show

Edit
Oh my goodness, woflfren! That's definitely a horror show of compiler errors. You're running into the classic Windows + Rust + C dependencies nightmare. But don't worry - I've got a solution that should work.

The problem is crystal clear now: gcc.exe is failing for all the C dependencies. This is happening because:

You're using the GNU toolchain on Windows (x86_64-pc-windows-gnu)
The gcc.exe executable either isn't installed properly, isn't in your PATH, or has some issue
The Definitive Solution: Switch to MSVC Toolchain
The easiest solution on Windows is to switch to the MSVC toolchain instead of GNU. Here's how to do it:

First, install the necessary MSVC tools if you don't have them:
Download and install Visual Studio Build Tools
In the installer, make sure to select "C++ build tools" - this will give you the MSVC compiler
Switch Rust to use the MSVC toolchain:
rustup default stable-msvc
Create a minimal .cargo/config.toml in your project folder:
toml
[build]
rustflags = ["-C", "target-feature=+crt-static"]
Update your Cargo.toml to use features that avoid C compilation when possible:
toml
[dependencies]
# Change these entries
sqlx = { version = "0.7", features = ["runtime-tokio-native-tls", "sqlite", "chrono", "json"], default-features = false }
zstd-sys = { version = "2.0.15", features = ["pkg-config"] }
libsqlite3-sys = { version = "0.26.0", features = ["bundled"] }
bzip2-sys = { version = "0.1.13", features = ["static"] }
Then try building again:
cargo clean
cargo build
Alternative Solution: Use a Pre-compiled Version
If the switch to MSVC doesn't work for some reason, or if you really need to stick with GNU, there's another approach:

Create a new cargo-features.toml file with only essential dependencies:
toml
[package]
name = "lobsterpot-minimal"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
tokio = { version = "1.34", features = ["full"] }
log = "0.4"
Create a minimal src/main.rs with:
rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, LobsterPot!");
}
Build this minimal version first:
cargo build
Then gradually add back dependencies, building after each addition to identify exactly which ones cause issues.
Last Resort: Run in Docker
If all else fails, you can create a simple Docker container to build and run your code:

dockerfile
FROM rust:latest

WORKDIR /app
COPY . .

RUN cargo build --release

CMD ["./target/release/lobsterpot"]
Let Me Know Which Option Works Best For You
Let me know which path you'd prefer to take. The MSVC toolchain should be the easiest and most reliable on Windows, but I'm here to help with any of these approaches.

Don't be discouraged by these issues - they're very common in Rust when dealing with C dependencies, especially on Windows. Once we get past these compilation issues, we can focus on the exciting lobsterpot functionality!
