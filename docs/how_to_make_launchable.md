Step 4: Build and Test LobsterPot
Navigate to Project:
powershell

Copy
cd D:\code\repos\GitHub_Desktop\lobsterpot
Clean and Build:
powershell

Copy
cargo clean
cargo build
Run:
powershell

Copy
cargo run
Debug Errors:
If cargo build fails, share the error output.
Common issues to watch for:
Module not found: Check mod.rs declarations.
Dependency errors: Verify Cargo.toml.
SmartCore/Nalgebra mismatch: Adjust versions or features.
Step 5: Integrate with “Swarms and Viewbot Armies”
You mentioned running “LobsterPot swarms” and “viewbot armies with massive proxy stream legions.” Assuming this is part of your project’s functionality (e.g., network monitoring, proxy handling), let’s ensure your code supports it:

Network Module:
src/network/monitor.rs and firewall.rs should handle proxy streams.
Add proxy support if missing (e.g., using reqwest for HTTP requests):


`# Cargo.toml`
`reqwest = { version = "0.11", features = ["tokio"] }`
